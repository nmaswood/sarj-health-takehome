# Healthcare AI Solutions: Wound Assessment & Voice Documentation

This project is designed to showcase AI-powered tools for healthcare professionals, including a **Wound Assessment** system using image analysis and a **Voice Documentation System** for transcribing clinical notes. The platform provides healthcare providers with tools to assess wound status based on uploaded images and transcribe medical dictations for efficient patient note management.

## Technologies

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **React** - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **Zod** - Schema validation library for input validation.
- **Lucide** - Icon library for UI components.
- **React Hook Form** - Form handling library.
- **Next.js** - React framework for server-side rendering.
- [**Speech-to-Text**](https://github.com/JamesBrill/react-speech-recognition?tab=readme-ov-file) - Transcription feature for voice dictation to clinical notes.
- **AI Image Analysis** - Simulated backend AI model for analyzing wound images.

## Features

- **Wound Assessment**: Upload an image of a wound, and the AI analyzes it to provide an assessment based on wound size, tissue health, and infection risk. The system provides personalized care recommendations.
  
- **Voice Documentation**: Record dictations, and the AI transcribes them into structured clinical notes, categorizing the text into sections such as Chief Complaint, History, Diagnosis, and Treatment Plan.
